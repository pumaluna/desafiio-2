         <p class="qsy-1">After the release of Peter Pan and before the grand opening of Disneyland, Walt and his team worked on a television series called Walt Disney’s Disneyland, which was later renamed to Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color. This is the very first time we see Tinker Bell in the intro, appearing after a firework explosion and tapping her pixie dust onto Walt’s name. Each land in Disneyland was given a part in the intro, with Tink dressing up in the appropriate attire for each. She continued to appear in the different variations of the intro, but eventually being sized down into a beam of light that guided your way through the outside of the castle. In 2014, The Wonderful World of Disney brought her back to her original form as the opener of the intro.</p>
        <p class="qsy-2">    In 2008, Tinker Bell was given her very own computer animated movie, which centered around her creation and time before Peter Pan. It was produced by Disneytoon Studios, who at the time were primarily producing direct-to-video Disney films. They went in a new direction for the character, and for the first time ever, gave her a voice. She was voiced by Mae Whitman, with costars such as Kristin Chenowith, Raven Symone, and Lucy Liu. The film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in September 2008. It was well received, becoming a phenomenon with children all across America, and developing the Disney Fairies franchise. Following the release of the film, Disneyland replaced Ariel’s Grotto with Pixie Hollow, a meet and greet area for Tinker Bell and her friends.</p>

                    <p class="intro">Tinker Bell is a 2008 computer animated film based on the Disney Fairies franchise produced by Disneytoon Studios. It revolves around Tinker Bell, a fairy character created by J. M. Barrie in his play, Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, and featured in the 1953 Disney animated feature film Peter Pan and its 2002 sequel Return to Never Land.
    Unlike Disney's two Peter Pan films featuring the character, which were produced primarily using traditional animation, Tinker Bell was produced using digital 3D modeling. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in North America by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on October 28, 2008, with several countries receiving a televised or theatrical release instead.</p>

On a scale of 1 to 5 stars, this movie is a 4.5/5. You can never go wrong with the first movie that creates an empire of fairy tales. It has it all: magic, a zoom up of the little fairy from Peter Pan, friendship, color. Nevertheless, there are better options for the final ranking.

As an animal fairy, Fawn must trust her heart and take a leap of faith if she hopes to rally the five fairies' to save the NeverBeast and prove that there is so much more to this mythical creature than just razor-sharp fangs and claws.</p>

Personal favorite. On a scale of 1 to 5 stars, I give this movie a 5/5. It's the first movie I remember watching at the cinema. I recall being so scared of the neverbeast at first, but that fear transformed into sadness when it had to go. It will always be a confort movie. I have watched it a lot of times and i hope i never stop.
